# Loss Aversion Analysis

This research investigates loss aversion in financial markets through quantitative analysis of stock market data. Loss aversion, a cornerstone of behavioral economics established by Kahneman and Tversky (1979), suggests that people weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains. This project seeks to identify and measure this phenomenon in stock market behavior using high-frequency trading data.
