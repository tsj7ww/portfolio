Hi, my name is Trevor Jordan and I currently work at Capital One focusing on credit loss mitigation strategy & analytics, with previous experience as a data analyst in operations and marketing. I studied economics at the University of Virginia, specializing in behavioral psychology and applied statistics. Also, I enjoy learning about technology and computer science in my free time.

## Projects

### Baseball Bets
Data Science & Risk Management project using various baseball data sources to predict game outcomes and make informed sports bets. Predictions are generated using statistical models in a two-tiered approach - one at the game level, and another using a Discrete Event Simulator. The forecasts are then compared against market odds to identify games with the highest potential ROI from placing bets. This is assessed across all games in a given period, and bets are placed strategically to minimize downside risk while still realizing significant profits.
