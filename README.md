Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Trevor and I currently work in strategy & analytics, with previous experience as a data analyst in operations and marketing. I studied economics at UVA with additional coursework in statistics and mathematics. I also enjoy learning about computer science and technology.

## Projects

### [Baseball Bets](./projects/baseball)
Data Science & Risk Management project using various baseball data sources to predict game outcomes and make informed sports bets. Predictions are generated using statistical models in a two-tiered approach - one at the game level, and another using a Discrete Event Simulator. The predictions are then compared against market odds to identify games with the highest potential ROI from placing bets. This is assessed across all games in a given time period, and bets are placed strategically in order to minimize downside risk while still realizing significant profits.

***Notes**:
  - This repo only contains a subset of the entire code in this project
  - This project is a work in progress

- **Skills**: Statistical Modeling, Prediction, Risk Management, Problem Solving, Monte Carlo Simulation
- **Technology**: Python, GBM Decision Tree
