Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Trevor Jordan and I currently work in strategy & analytics at a bank, with previous experience as a data analyst in operations and marketing. I studied economics at UVA with additional coursework in statistics, math, and psychology. I also enjoy learning about technology and computer science in my free time.

## Projects

### Baseball Bets
Data Science & Risk Management project using various baseball data sources to predict game outcomes and make informed sports bets. Predictions are generated using statistical models in a two-tiered approach - one at the game level, and another using a Discrete Event Simulator. The forecasts are then compared against market odds to identify games with the highest potential ROI from placing bets. This is assessed across all games in a given period, and bets are placed strategically to minimize downside risk while still realizing significant profits.
- **Skills**: Statistical Modeling, Prediction, Risk Management, Problem-Solving, Event Simulation
- **Technology**: Python, XG Boost (Gradient Boosted Decision Tree) Model, Neural Network
- **Resources**: [Data Preprocessing](./projects/baseball/preprocess.ipynb), [ReadMe](./projects/baseball#readme), [Project Folder](./projects/baseball)
- **Timeline**: January 2023 - Present

### Predictive Modeling
Using housing data from Kaggle, I created a machine-learning regression model to predict housing prices based on residence attributes.
- **Skills**: Prediction, Modeling, Problem-Solving, Data Analysis
- **Technology**: Python, Regression Modeling, SkLearn
- **Resources**: [Python Notebook](./projects/housing/main.ipynb), [ReadMe](./projects/housing#readme), [Project Folder](./projects/housing)
- **Timeline**: February 2022 - April 2022

### Time Series Forecasting
Data Science project that uses a variety of Time Series models (SARIMA, Prophet, Theta) to forecast COVID-19 cases in Richmond, VA.
- **Skills**: Prediction, Forecasting, Time Series, Data Analytics, Problem-Solving
- **Technology**: Python, Prophet, SkTime, SARIMA model
- **Resources**: [Python Notebook (Prophet)](./projects/covid/prophet.ipynb), [Python Notebook (PmdArima)](./projects/covid/pmdarima.ipynb), [Python Notebook (SkTime)](./projects/covid/sktime.ipynb), [ReadMe](./projects/covid#readme), [Project Folder](./projects/covid)
- **Timeline**: January 2021 - March 2021
