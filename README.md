Hi, my name is Trevor Jordan and I am currently working at Capital One focusing on loss mitigation strategy & analytics, with previous experience as a data analyst in operations and marketing. I studied economics at the University of Virginia, specializing in behavior psychology and applied statistics. Also, I enjoy learning about technology and computer science in my free time.
